# Towards an Optimal Remote Photo-Plethysmographic Framework using Weighted Ensemble Models
Assignment and Course Project Repository for ECE239AS (Computational Imaging), Fall 2020.
Project is concerned about remote heart rate detection (rPPG) from video frames using optimal weighted ensembles of rPPG models.

Remote photo-plethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact means of blood volume pulse (BVP) detection through light transmittance variations from the skin, measured using consumer-level cameras. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach of fusing rPPG algorithms using weights extracted via linear optimization on the residuals and absolute errors on two standard rPPG video datasets. Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) rPPG techniques, namely CHROM, POS and ICA, were fused and observed to reduce average root-squared and absolute deviations by 24% and 18% respectively over individual models and vanilla fusion techniques, achieving an upper quartile of Â± 5.0 bpm.
